```

## Tools and Technologies

- React
- Typescript
- CSS Modules
- Vitest

## Despite this application is deployed, there are things to be improved and fixed

- [ ] Avoid divison by 0
- [x] Add third theme
- [ ] Avoid add more than one dot (".") in each part of expression, like: **4,5,5** + 2
- [ ] Write new unit tests, the tests actually are outdated
- [ ] Refactor code modularing some parts like buttons
- [ ] Bonus: Have initial theme preference checked using prefers-color-scheme and have any additional changes saved in the browser
